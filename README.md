# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we worked on was not ideal, so we processed it to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we were looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. In this deliverable we used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

We followed a four step process;
- 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
